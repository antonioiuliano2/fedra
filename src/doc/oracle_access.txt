 How to access ORACLE from FEDRA and ROOT
------------------------------------------

       -----------------

1) Lets call the client computer as "thislinuxpc"
   First of all it is necessary to have the ORACLE client and OCCI on the thislinuxpc 
   (Ask the sysadmin first if it is alredy exist there!)
   
    The simpliest way to obtain it is to install oracleinstantclient. 
    For linux it means 3 files:

    instantclient-basic-linux-x86-64-10.1.0.3.zip    - client itself
    instantclient-sdk-linux-x86-64-10.1.0.3.zip      - occi inside
    instantclient-sqlplus-linux-x86-64-10.1.0.3.zip  - useful guy

    The files can be download from the oracle site (if you are not an arabian terrorist).
    The versions can be different - (for example 64 means 64-bit operation system. 
    most probably your's OS is 32-bit, so take files without 64)

    just unzip files into the same subdirectory and then create or edit the script

    setoracleclient.sh
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ### required for occi (access from c++):
    export OCCIHOME=/sw/oracle/instantclient_10_2
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$OCCIHOME
    export PATH=$PATH:$OCCIHOME

    ### required for $TNS_ADMIN/tnsnames.ora
    export TNS_ADMIN=/sw/oracle 

    ### required for $ORACLE_HOME/sqplus/admin/glogon.sql  (optional)
    export ORACLE_HOME=/sw/oracle 
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Put the correct paths inside

    after that you should be able to start sqlplus and access your favorite database:
    (Note that you do not need superuser priveledge to do all the above)

    > sqlplus 

    you will be asked for username and password. Note that sqlplus try to connect to the 
    default service which sould be setted in file tnsnames.ora if it do not exist yet it can be 
    done explicitly as:
 
    sqlplus username\/password\@\"\(DESCRIPTION=\(ADDRESS_LIST=\(ADDRESS=\(PROTOCOL=TCP\)\(HOST=10.10.10.2\)\(PORT=1521\)\)\)\(CONNECT_DATA=\(SERVICE_NAME=dbopera.boh.infn.it\)\)\)\"

    with the correct username, password, host (database server address) and service_name

    if the login is happy one should be able to send sql instructure for example:

    SQL> select table_name from user_tables;   - will print the list of all users tables
    SQL> desc TB_MIPBASETRACKS;
    etc...

2) Instead of recompiling root from source with the Oracle support and doing each time configuration as:
  ./configure  --enable-oracle  --with-oracle-incdir=/sw/oracle/instantclient_10_2/sdk/include  --with-oracle-libdir=/sw/oracle/instantclient_10_2

  this (small) library with the functions added for emulsion specific data access is included into 
  FEDRA distribution as libEOracle

  after the succesfull compilation one can try to access db as 

  root [0] TSQLServerE *db=TSQLServer::Connect("oracle://dbserver.boh.infn.it:1521/dbopera","username","password");

  I newer succeded to put inside the Connect the complex database address. To simplify it it is 
  usefull to put database service definitions into tnsnames.ora file.
  the file to be installed in $TNS_ADMIN directory
  after that it is possible to do the connect like this:

  root [0] TSQLServer *db=TSQLServer::Connect("oracle://thislinuxpc/dbopera","username","password");

  the example of the tnsnames.ora file is:
----------------------------------------------
dbopera =
 (DESCRIPTION =
  (ADDRESS_LIST =
   (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.10.10.2)(PORT = 1521))
  )
  (CONNECT_DATA =
   (SERVICE_NAME = dboperan.boh.infn.it)
  )
 )
---------------------------------------------

3) onse the connection from root to oracle is working one can 
   get out some numbers from db using the root scripts like:

   void get_tree()
   { 
     TOracleServerE *db=TSQLServer::Connect("oracle://thislinuxpc/dbopera","user","passwd");
     TTree *t = new TTree("t","t");
     db->QueryTree("select * from tb_plates",t);
   }

   all content of the requested sql query will be copied into the tree t

4) scan data can be accesed also directly from fedra with the use of the functions: 

   TOracleServerE::ReadVolume(long long id_volume, EdbPatternsVolume &vol);
   TOracleServerE::ReadZplate(int id_plate, int id_eventbrick, EdbPattern &pat);
   TOracleServerE::ReadBasetracksPattern(char *selection, EdbPattern &pat);
