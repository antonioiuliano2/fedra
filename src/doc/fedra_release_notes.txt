Subject: Fedra release 21-11-03

Dear friends,

I put on the cvs the new release of Fedra.

The main new features:

- all code is compilable under Win32 and gcc3.2, (not only gcc2.96 as before)
- new building utilities for Windows (Gabriele)
- new install script for Linux (Markus)
- under windows new root was tested succesfully: root3.10.01gdk
  (recommended by the root team). Fedra libraries tested with new root
- some image processing tools (FIR, clasterization, etc) is added (Linux only yet)
- event display (by Igor)  is added to the distribution as the separate library: libEdd
- added the possibility to do the fast traceback (from track to raw segment)

During this activity some bugs were introduced and then fixed, so if you got the
code from the cvs in the last 3 weeks and experienced some crashes it could be useful
to move to the last version.

As concerning the priciple algorithms them do not changed in this version

About the installation refere to the file
http://ntslab01.na.infn.it/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/fedra/README.INSTALL


Example of the Display usage:

// Usage: (script testd.C)
//
//	EdbDisplay*  ds;
//	void testd()
//	{
//	gSystem->Load("libEdd.so");
//	gStyle->SetPalette(1);
//	ds=new EdbDisplay("display-t",-6000.,6000.,-6000.,6000.,-20050,110.);
//	ds->SetCuts(-9000,9000,-9000,9000); //Coordinate cuts
//	  TTree *tree;
//	  TFile *f = new TFile("linked_tracks.root");
//	  if (f)  tree = (TTree*)f->Get("tracks");
//	  ds->SetAffine(1,0,0,1,0,0);
//	  ds->SetNsegmin(4);
//	  ds->AddTracksTree(tree,0.,-1.,1.,-1.,1.);
//	  ds->Refresh();
//	}

Example of Image Processing usage in the interactive root session:

  gStyle->SetPalette(1);
  EdbImage *image = new EdbImage("/mnt/nusrv4_2/week/imm.bmp","BMP");
  TH1F *h1 = image->GetHist1();               // pixels amplitude
  TH2F *ccd = image->GetHist2(1);             // raw image (inverted)
  EdbFIRF  *fir = new EdbFIRF("6x6A");
  TH2F *img = fir->ApplyTo(image);            //filtered image
  img->Draw("colZ");

  EdbIP::Clusterize(img, 1000);    // find clusters with threshold 1000
                                   // output went to clusters.root


How to find the raw segment for a given track segment from tracks tree:

linked_tracks.root: s.eVid[0] - pieceID (02001 = plate*1000+piece)
                    s.eVid[1] - entry number in the correspondent couples tree

02_001.cp.root:     s1.eVid[0] - viewID in the Views tree
                    s1.eVid[1] - entryID in the array of segments
                                 in the correspondent view

I put on the cvs the new tarball with the updated version. The list of
the main new features:

- new cards in the parameter file (default.par):

	CLUST   0   # 1- with grains analysis (time consuming), 0 - no grains

		if this card is 1, "recset -l" will read also grains from the Views tree.
		For the time being the grain analisys is just the calculation of the sum of
		all pixels/segment into the new variable of s1/s2 : eVolume.

	#	   	  x0	  	 y0		z0	tx  ty
	VOLUME0		-60000.		55000.		0.	0.  0.
	VOLUMEA	  	 5000.	 	5000.

		These 2 cards define the brick volume to be analised, defined as
		the space point (x0,y0,z0), direction (tx,ty) and acceptance in (dx,dy).
		(directions are assumed to be 0 for the moment)
		The data selection is applied from the very beginning (from linking).
		So in the above example only 1cm x 1cm zone with the center at (x0,y0)
		will be readed from the raw data (Views tree) and linked.
		The coordinates are the same wich arrive later to the couples tree:
		stage coordinate if "AFID 0"
		fiducial coordinates if "AFID 1".
		It is very convenient with the new data set to select first the small area (volume),
		in this case the full data chain upto tracking with N plates and tuning
		of all parameters could be passed in a few minutes, after that the acceptance
		could be increased.

		If these 2 cards are commented out, x0 and y0 are assumed to be 0 with infinite
		acceptance.

		Once selected the center of dataset is better not to change it, in this
		case the affine transformations (alignment) found with the different position
		cuts will be compatible with high precision.

New options of recset:

recset { l | a | t | at | ...} input_data_set_file

                  ccd - to remove ccd defects (update par/xxx.par file)
                  l   - link up/down
                  ang - correct up/down angles offset and rotations
                  a   - plate to plate alignment
                  at  - alignment+tracking (could be used for prealigned data)
                  f   - fine alignment based on passed-throw tracks
                  t   - tracking

ccd - will update par/*.par files with the position cuts (XCUT) removing 1micron X 1micron area
 	around the peaks provocated by CCD spots. The procedure will be done for all data pieces
	switched on in runs.lst file. This procedure should be done just once.

l   - link up/down (as usual), calculate the shrinkage correction and update it
	in par/*.par files (automatically)
	If shrinkage is significantly changed - usefull to do one more iteration.

ang - optional (see README for details)

f   - (see README)

Note that now all parameters corrections found by program will be automatically
updated to correspondent par/*.par files. This updates could be checked and edited
manually if necessary.

Please check

for the more details.

I put on the CVS the new tarball with an updated version.
The main new features:

- new cards in parameter files:
	AFID    0   # 1-use fiducial marks, 0 - stage coord (as written in run files)

	# CUTCP can be used before alignment and linking:
	# Max for:  	N1  	N1tot	N2 	N2tot	Chi2	Chi2P
	CUTCP 0		1	10	1	10	5.	5.


- automatic update of shrinkage after link procedure:
	recset l ...
	in *.par files appear new lines
	SHRINK 1 ...
	SHRINK 2 ...
	if procedure repeated the new parameters will be taken from par files

- automatic update of affine transformation after align procedure
	recset a ...
	in *.par files appear new line
	AFFINE 0 ....
	if procedure repeated the new parameters will be taken from par files
	it is convenient to do first align iteration with small subset of data
	(use ICUT 0.... ; XCUT 0 .... to reduce the amount of basetracks)

- new options of recset:
        recset { l | a | t | at} input_data_set_file

                  l  - link up/down
                  a  - plate to plate alignment
                  t  - tracking
                  at - alignment+tracking (could be used for prealigned data)

- after tracking procedure 2 "new" output files:

	recset [a]t ....

	linked_couples.root - contained all couples for aligned and
		linked patterns: basetrack<->basetrack
	        The branches are:
		s1 - first segment
		s2 - second segment
		s  - linked segment: s1+s2
		cp - quality parameters

	linked_tracks.root - contained all chains of segments for all patterns (aka tracks)
		The branches are:
		nseg - number of segments
		s    - the array of segments with length = nseg
		t    - one segment = Mean(all segments from s) i.e. "track"
		npl  ==nseg at the moment
		n0   - not used yet

The code is fresh, so let me know about all possible inconsistencies. I decided
to release it beacuse the additional output can be very useful for the analysis
you are doing.

Regards,
Valeri
